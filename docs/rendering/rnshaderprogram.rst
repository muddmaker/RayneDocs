Overview
========

A ShaderProgream encapsulates a completely compiled and linked shader program that can be used for rendering. It's immutable and created through the :cpp:class:`Shader` class. A ShaderProgram shouldn't be cached since the source shader object may invalidate it later on, instead, it should be requested again from the source shader object which will maintain a cache to it.

The default uniform locations described in the `Properties`_ section are automatically resolved using their name, eg, `matProj` will contain the uniform location of the uniform named `matProj` in the shader, if it exists. Additionally, these default built in uniforms are automatically bound to the right data by the renderer.

Tasks

Requesting information
----------------------

* :cpp:func:`HasGeometryShader() const <ShaderProgram::HasGeometryShader>`
* :cpp:func:`HasTessellationShader() const <ShaderProgram::HasTessellationShader>`
* :cpp:func:`GetLocation(const std::string &name) <ShaderProgram::GetLocation>`


Instance Methods
================

.. class:: ShaderProgram
	
	.. function:: bool HasGeometryShader() const

		Returns true if the shader program has a linked geometry shader

	.. function:: bool HasTessellationShader() const

		Returns true if the shader program has linked tessellation shaders

	.. function:: GLuint GetLocation(const std::string &name)

		Returns the location of the uniform with the given name, or -1 if the uniform doesn't exist. This method should be favoured over calling `glGetUniformLocation()` as it maintains a cache of already resolved uniform locations.

	.. member:: std::vector<GLuint> texlocations

		Vector with the texture uniform locations. Textures are automatically bound to the shader uniforms with names `mTexture0` to `mTexture31`, though names can be skipped (ie `mTexture0`, `mTexture2` to only have the first and third texture of the material bound).

	.. member:: std::vector<GLuint> texinfolocations

		Vector with the texture info locations. Similar naming as the texture location vector, but with `Info` appended. Eg `mTexture0Info`. The uniforms are a vec4  with the dimension of the texture bound to it. xy contain 1.0 / width and 1.0 / height respectively, zw contain the width and height.
